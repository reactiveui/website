# Accountability-and-expectations

A great software engineering team is vital for the success of a Open Source Project.

Therefore, many resources, time, and knowledge go into improving their performance, making them more productive and creative, and rightfully so.

However, the key ingredient in leveling up their performance is often accountability. Great software engineers hold themselves accountable for their actions and mistakes.

In this article, we’ll dig into the ways to build an accountability culture in software engineering.

When a software engineer is wrapped up in their day-to-day work, there are so many things to keep in mind that it’s hard to focus on something as intangible as accountability.

However, nurturing an accountability culture is vital for building trust among software engineers.

When engineers explain their actions, thought processes, and decisions made during software development, the bond between the team members strengthens.

In other words, embracing accountability facilitates collaboration and openness among software engineers.

It’s important to establish a culture in which taking ownership and admitting to one’s mistakes is normal and necessary, and not a punishment, which is what 80% of people perceive it as.

You can remind your software engineers about the importance of accountability by providing them with the context of their work.

Why are they doing a particular project or task? What purpose will it serve when it’s completed?

Knowing that will help them focus and commit to their part in the project, as explained.

Instead of telling your software engineers what to do, you can ask them what they think they should do.

This will help them take ownership of their work and feel more accountable for their actions.

When you ask your software engineers for their opinions, you’re also showing them that you trust them and value their input.

This will help them feel more confident and motivated to do their best work.

When you’re working on a project, it’s important to set clear expectations for your software engineers.

This will help them understand what they need to do and how they should do it.

When you set clear expectations, you’re also showing your software engineers that you trust them to do their best work.

This will help them feel more confident and motivated to do their best work.
