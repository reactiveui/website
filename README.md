# ReactiveUI Website

![Build website](https://github.com/reactiveui/website/workflows/Build%20website/badge.svg)

This is the source code for the [ReactiveUI](https://www.reactiveui.net/) website. It's a static site generated by [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html).

## Contributing

**Steps**
1. Fork the current project
2. Create a new branch, if needed
3. Clone the project
4. In order to build and host the docs do the following:
**Windows** -- Open command prompt and install/update the following tools:
- the DocFx tool `dotnet tool update -g docfx`
- the Nuke tool `dotnet tool update Nuke.GlobalTool --global`
 
- Open command prompt at the repository root folder, ensure that you have installed the DocFx tool and then run `docfx reactiveui/docfx.json --serve`

5. Wait several minutes while it installs dependencies and initializes (approx 5 mins).  It is ready when you see `Hit Ctrl-C to exit`
6. Browse the website on `localhost:8080`
---

To build the entire Website we use `Nuke BuildWebsite` you will need to install the tool so that you can run command line nuke commands using `dotnet tool install Nuke.GlobalTool --global`.

---
Once installed from the command prompt execute `Nuke` this will download and build the sources for the API section of the website, this takes around 35 minutes to compile and build the website with the API sections.

---
Once complete you can either execute `docfx reactiveui/docfx.json --serve` to run the site OR `Nuke BuildWebsite` to build the API only.

---
If you have generated the API section and wish to remove it on your local machine to enable the website to compile faster, run `nuke Clean` and then run `docfx reactiveui/docfx.json --serve`
