# ReactiveUI Website

![Build website](https://github.com/reactiveui/website/workflows/Build%20website/badge.svg)

This is the ReactiveUI website. It's a static site generated by [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html).

## Contributing

**Steps**
1. Fork the current project
2. Create a new branch, if needed
3. Clone the project
4. In order to build and host the docs do the following:
- **Windows**
-- Open command prompt at the repository root folder and run `docfx reactiveui/docfx.json --serve`
5. Wait several minutes while it installs dependencies and initializes (approx 35 mins).  It is ready when you see `Hit Ctrl-C to exit`
6. Browse the website on `localhost:8080`

To build the entire Website we use `Nuke Build` you will need to install the tool so that you can run command line nuke commands.
Once installed from the command prompt execute `Nuke` this will download and build the sources for the API section of the website.
Once complete you can either execute `docfx reactiveui/docfx.json --serve` to run the site OR `Nuke BuildWebsite` to build the API only.
