Title: PRISM
---

> Prism is all about guidance. It helps you create a well architected, maintainable, extensible, and most importantly testable application.  It does this by enforcing various design patterns that create abstractions necessary to achieve these goals.  For example, Prism always forces you to program to an interface. You are asking for INavigationService, IEventAggregator, IDeviceService, etc.  This forces your VM's to be testable as you can mock all of these interfaces in your tests.  You will never access a static class in a Prism app as that will be very difficult to test.  Unlike in plain Xamarin.Forms everything is done in the code-behind of your page (ie Navigation and ShowAlert/ActionSheet), or even worse via a static class.  It's nearly impossible to properly unit test a plain Xamarin.Forms application.  Prism doesn't really do anything special.  It simply abstracts away the statics and most common platform tasks into more testable patterns. - Brian Lagunas
