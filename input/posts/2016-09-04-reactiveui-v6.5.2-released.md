Tags: Release Notes

<!--excerpt-->

This release resolves a NuGet metadata defect which was preventing the installation of ReactiveUI into Windows Phone projects (issue https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/1146). The assemblies within v6.5.2 are the same as those found in v6.5.1 and v6.5.0. 

For new projects, we recommend joining us in Slack and using the v7 nightlies which are available from MyGet as we are in the final stages of preparing for the release of v7.0.0.
