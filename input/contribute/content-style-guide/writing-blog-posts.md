ReactiveUI's blog posts are written by people from from all walks of life. We love having maintainers, contributors and businesses blog about their experiences with programming in an reactive manner. The person most familiar with the subject is in the best position to convey it. 

## Basics

The ReactiveUI blog is the central, authoritative voice of the project and we generally publish:

* Feature, release, and announcements
* Tips and tricks related to reactive programming
* ReactiveUI user case studies

## Guidelines
When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](voice-and-tone) and [Grammar and mechanics](grammar-and-mechanics) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

## Be casual, but smart
This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

## Be specific
If you're writing about data, put the numbers in context. If you're writing about a ReactiveUI application, give the reader plenty of information about the company, project methodology, which platforms they used, amount of developers, in-house or outsourced, experience with reactive programming, and results.


## Get to the point
Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads. Developers are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

## Link it up
Feel free to link away from ReactiveUI if it helps you explain something.

## Use tags and keywords
Add keywords that apply to your article. Look through existing posts for common tags. If you’re not sure if a word should be a tag, it probably shouldn’t.

## Use pictures
Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you’re explaining how to use MailChimp, include screenshots to illustrate your point. Make sure to use alt text.
