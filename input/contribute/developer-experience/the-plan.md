ReactiveUI is the father of the extremely popular ReactiveCocoa AKA "RAC" (and also by extension ReactiveSwift) which literaly transformed and changed the way iOS software development is done. Whilst Paul was working at GitHub, the team behind ReactiveCocoa (also GitHub employees) ported the concepts behind ReactiveUI to iOS via much beer and coffee  :-)

IMHO (Geoff here) the .NET ecosystem is behind the eightball with reactive programming _even though we are the ecosystem that invented the reactive extensions_. This is super embarassing. Alot has changed in the nine years since the birth of the Reactive Extensions, there's been huge growth in the Javascript community (all angular developers, now must know reactive programming, the birth of the much loved ELM framework), Scala (server-side; play framework) and in partical the (Java "native") Android Mobile commuinity have turned to the reactive extnensions to help cope with the complexity of Android development. 

Why? It's cause the the developer experience (documentation, samples, people presenting and sharing their experiences at meetups) has been lacking. Let's fix this.
