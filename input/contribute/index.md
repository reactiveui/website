ReactiveUI is developed under an OSI-approved <a href="https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/main/LICENSE">open source license</a>, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. Because of our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/reactivemarbles">ReactiveUI model for funding and transparency</a>, we are able to funnel support and funds through to our contributors and community. We ❤ the people who are involved in this project, and we’d love to have you on board, especially if you are just getting started or have never contributed to open-source before.

So here's to you, lovely person who wants to join us — this is how you can support us:

# Every open source project loves new contributors
and there are lots and lots of people who would love to contribute to Open Source, but <i>don't know how</i>.

So what is missing? There is a huge difference between welcoming Pull Requests and creating a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/688542/" target="_blank">contributor-friendly community</a>. That's why ReactiveUI maintains a curated backlog of tasks for people who have never contributed to the project before or are completely new to open-source</a>. Often it takes more time to prepare these tasks than to actually implement them. We do this because of the message it sends to someone who is new to the project. It shows that we clearly care about people coming here, that we want them to succeed and that we are here to help. We invest in you, in hope that you will stick around and pay it forward when you are ready. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/graphs/contributors">current list of contributors</a>.
