Elijah Reva noticed a `net461` regression that affected Windows Presentation Foundation and Windows Forms. During the netstandard refactor we missed renaming a compilation symbol which resulted in `PropertyChangedEventManager.DeliverEvent` being used when setting reactive properties. WeakEventManager [should not be used](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/661) on these platforms and this hotfix disables it.

Thank you Elijah for sending in this the hotfix - check your email for an invitation to the GitHub organization!

As part of this release we had [8 commits](https://github.com/reactiveui/reactiveui/compare/8.0.0...8.0.1) which resulted in [3 issues](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues?milestone=10&state=closed) being closed.
