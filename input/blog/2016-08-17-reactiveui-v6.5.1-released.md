<!--excerpt-->

This release resolves a NuGet metadata defect which was preventing the installation of ReactiveUI into portable class libraries that targeted `Profile259`. The assemblies within v6.5.1 are the same as those found in v6.5.0.

For new projects, we recommend joining us in Slack and using the v7 nightlies which are available from MyGet as we are in the final stages of preparing for the release of v7.0.0.
