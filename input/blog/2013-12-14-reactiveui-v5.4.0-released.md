## [What's New](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/compare/5.3.0...5.4.0)

Since some of these fixes change behavior (such as the NLog fix), this is a minor release - however, most of these changes _shouldn't_ affect existing programs

- Fixes to deserializing ReactiveObjects using certain serializers (#412, thanks @meteficha)
- Small improvements to derived collections (#417, thanks @meteficha)
- Change NLog to use the full class name so it is easier to filter on (thanks @npnelson)
- Race condition and reentrancy fixes to Reactive(Table/Collection)ViewSource (#425 + #426 + #433, thanks @meteficha)
- Remove Pex from the list of test runners because it conflicts with WriteableBitmapEx (#428, thanks @tiagomargalho)
