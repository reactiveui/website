Release 8.4.4 of ReactiveUI is available!

Unfortunately there was a [WPF regression](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/pull/1710) in the previous release which was promptly resolved by Glenn Watson within hours. Thank-you Michael Stonis for sending a pull-request that adds support for generating the events in Xamarin Essentials.

As part of this release we had [3 commits](https://github.com/reactiveui/reactiveui/compare/8.4.1...8.4.4).
