# ReplaySubject\<T\>.Subscribe Method

Subscribes an observer to the subject.

**Namespace:**  [System.Reactive.Subjects](System.Reactive.Subjects/System.Reactive.Subjects)  
**Assembly:**  System.Reactive (in System.Reactive.dll)

## Syntax

```vb
'Declaration
Public Function Subscribe ( _
    observer As IObserver(Of T) _
) As IDisposable
```

```vb
'Usage
Dim instance As ReplaySubject
Dim observer As IObserver(Of T)
Dim returnValue As IDisposable

returnValue = instance.Subscribe(observer)
```

```csharp
public IDisposable Subscribe(
    IObserver<T> observer
)
```

```c++
public:
virtual IDisposable^ Subscribe(
    IObserver<T>^ observer
) sealed
```

```fsharp
abstract Subscribe : 
        observer:IObserver<'T> -> IDisposable 
override Subscribe : 
        observer:IObserver<'T> -> IDisposable 
```

```javascript
public final function Subscribe(
    observer : IObserver<T>
) : IDisposable
```

#### Parameters

- observer  
  Type: [System.IObserver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd783449)\<[T](ReplaySubject/ReplaySubject(T))\>  
  Observer to subscribe to the subject.

#### Return Value

Type: [System.IDisposable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aax125c9)  
IDisposable object that can be used to unsubscribe the observer from the subject.

#### Implements

[IObservable\<T\>.Subscribe(IObserver\<T\>)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/m:system.iobservable%601.subscribe(system.iobserver%7b%600%7d)(v=VS.103))

## Remarks

Calling Subscribe creates a subscription to the ReplaySubject’s IObservable interface. The ReplaySubject will publish the items it receives from its own subscription(s) through its IObservable interface.

## Examples

In this example we have created a NewsHeadlineFeed class which is just a mock news feed in the form of an observable sequence of strings. It uses the Generate operator to continuoously generate a random news headline within three seconds.

A ReplaySubject is created to subscribe to two news feeds of the NewsHeadlineFeed class. Before the subject is subscribed to the feeds, the Timestamp operator is used to timestamp each headline. So the sequence that the ReplaySubject actually subscribes to is of the type IObservable\<Timestamped\<string\>\>. With the headline sequence timestamped, subscribers can subscribe to the subject's observable interface to observe the data stream(s) or a subset of the stream(s) based on the timestamp.

A ReplaySubject buffers items it receives. So a subscription created at a later time can access items from the sequence which have already been buffered and published. A subscriptions is created to the ReplaySubject that receives only local news headlines which occurred 10 seconds before the local news subscription was created. So we basically have the ReplaySubject "replay" what happened 10 seconds earlier.

A local news headline just contains the newsLocation substring ("in your area.").

The following output was generated with the example code. The new feeds are random so it is possible that you may have to run it more than once to see a local news headline.

    Waiting for 10 seconds before subscribing to local news headline feed.
