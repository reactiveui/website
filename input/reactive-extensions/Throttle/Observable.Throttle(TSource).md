# Observable.Throttle\<TSource\> Method (IObservable\<TSource\>, TimeSpan, IScheduler)

Ignores the values from an observable sequence which are followed by another value before due time with the specified source, dueTime and scheduler.

**Namespace:**  [System.Reactive.Linq](System.Reactive.Linq/System.Reactive.Linq)  
**Assembly:**  System.Reactive (in System.Reactive.dll)

## Syntax

    source As IObservable(Of TSource), _
    dueTime As TimeSpan, _
    scheduler As IScheduler _
) As IObservable(Of TSource)
```

```vb
'Usage

```csharp
public static IObservable<TSource> Throttle<TSource>(
    this IObservable<TSource> source,
    TimeSpan dueTime,
    IScheduler scheduler
)
```

```c++
[ExtensionAttribute]
public:
generic<typename TSource>
static IObservable<TSource>^ Throttle(
    IObservable<TSource>^ source, 
    TimeSpan dueTime, 
    IScheduler^ scheduler
)
```

```fsharp
static member Throttle : 
        source:IObservable<'TSource> * 
        dueTime:TimeSpan * 
        scheduler:IScheduler -> IObservable<'TSource> 
```

```javascript
JScript does not support generic types and methods.
```

#### Type Parameters

- TSource  
  The type of source.

#### Parameters

- source  
  Type: [System.IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd990377)\<TSource\>  
  The source sequence to throttle.

- dueTime  
  Type: [System.TimeSpan](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/269ew577)  
  The duration of the throttle period for each value.

- scheduler  
  Type: [System.Reactive.Concurrency.IScheduler](IScheduler/IScheduler)  
  The scheduler to run the throttle timers on.

#### Return Value

Type: [System.IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd990377)\<TSource\>  
The values from an observable sequence which are followed by another value before due time.

#### Usage Note

In Visual Basic and C\#, you can call this method as an instance method on any object of type [IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd990377)\<TSource\>. When you use instance method syntax to call this method, omit the first parameter. For more information, see [](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb384936) or [](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb383977).

## Remarks

The Throttle operator buffers an item from the sequence and wait for the time span specified by the dueTime parameter to expire. If another item is produced from the sequence before the time span expires, then that item replaces the old item in the buffer and the wait starts over. If the due time does expire before another item is produced in the sequence, them that item is observed through any subscriptions to the sequence.

## Examples

This example demonstrates using the throttle operator to guarantee that items are observed at an interval no faster than two seconds. This is demonstrated by using the EndlessBarrageOfEmails method to continuously yield emails that are produced as items in an observable sequence. The email items in the sequence occur at random intervals within three seconds from each other. Only the items that occur with no item following it for the two second time span are observed from the sequence.
