  Type: [System.IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd990377)\<TSource\>  
  An observable sequence to aggregate over.

- seed  
  Type: TAccumulate  
  The initial accumulator value.

- accumulator

#### Usage Note

In Visual Basic and C\#, you can call this method as an instance method on any object of type [IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Dd990377)\<TSource\>. When you use instance method syntax to call this method, omit the first parameter.

## Remarks

The aggregate operator is used to apply a function across a source sequence to produce an aggregate or accumulated value. The function applied across the sequence is called an accumulator function. It requires two parameters: an accumulator value, and an item from the sequence which is processed with the accumulator value. The initial accumulator value is called the seed value and must be provided to the aggregate operator. The accumulator function returns the new accumulator value each time it is called. The new accumulator value is then used with the next call to the accumulator function to process the item in the sequence. These calls continue until the end of the sequence.

The aggregate operator returns an observable sequence which is of the same type as the seed value which is passed into the operator. To obtain the final aggregate value, you subscribe to the observable sequence returned from the aggregate operator. Once the accumulator function has been applied across the entire sequence, the observer’s OnNext and OnCompleted handlers provided in the subscription are called to provide the final aggregate value. See the example code provided with this operator.

## Examples

This example demonstrates using the aggregate operator to count the vowels in a string of characters generated at runtime with Console.Readkey(). The CountVowels function is the accumulator function and it increments the count of each vowel encountered in the sequence.

Here is example output from the example code.

    Enter a sequence of characters followed by the ENTER key.
    The example code will count the vowels you enter
    
    This is a sequence of char I am generating from Console.ReadKey()
    
    Vowel Final Count = A:5, E:8, I:4, O:4, U:1
    
    
    Press ENTER to exit...
