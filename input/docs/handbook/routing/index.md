View-First or ViewModel-First?

Whether you can use VM-based routing (i.e. RoutedViewHost, IScreen, RoutingState, and friends) in ReactiveUI depends on the platform you're on:

* WPF, Xamarin Forms: Absolutely
* WP8, WinRT: You can make it work, you lose some transitions and niceties
* Android, iOS Native: Very difficult to make work

# XAML-based Platforms

In the App.xaml file register your viewmodels (If you want the viewmodel based navigation)
```    
this.Router = new RoutingState();
Locator.CurrentMutable.RegisterConstant(this, typeof(IScreen));
Locator.CurrentMutable.Register(() => new LoginPage(), typeof(IViewFor<LoginViewModel>));
Locator.CurrentMutable.Register(() => new RegisterPage(), typeof(IViewFor<RegisterViewModel>));
```
To start the app and navigate to the default page login page in our case use the below code
```
this.Router.Navigate.Execute(new HomeViewModel());
MainPage = new RoutedViewHost();
```
You can implement logic here checking if the user has a valid token and may be navigate to the home page bypassing the login page. It could be a check with in the akavache storage for the presense of a token. Below is the sample loginviewmodel
```
public LoginViewModel(IScreen screen = null)
{
    HostScreen = screen ?? Locator.Current.GetService<IScreen>();
    var canLogin = this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.Email, x => x.Password, 
        (email, password) => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(email) && 
                             !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(password));

    _isLoading = Login.IsExecuting.ToProperty(this, x => x.IsLoading);
    
    Register = ReactiveCommand.CreateFromObservable(
        () => HostScreen.Router.Navigate.Execute(new RegSelectionViewModel())
    );

    Login = ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask<object, LoginResponse>(
        () => { /* Handle Login here */ }, canLogin);
}
```

In the above view model `canLogin` will listen to changes in the email and password fields and can enable the login command if the fields are not empty. One can even do a regex based email validation. One thing would be to bind this command to a login button inside your view like below:
```
this.BindCommand(ViewModel, vm => vm.Login, v => v.loginButton) ;
```

@moswald: I see how that could work.  I give up the default binding goodness of the command

@michaelteper: Not sure I follow where you are indicating to put those subjects

phil.cleveland [8:19 AM]
My original design had each page impl the Next and Back and also the xaml for the buttons.  I didn't like it because each page then had to know about all the other pages it could possibly go to or go back to.  So I moved all the logic to the shell, but that forces me to recreate the command each time a page changes. (Which I think is legit, but doesn't work)

moswald [8:20 AM] 
well, my solution is a little bit wrong, combine it with @michaelteper's

moswald [8:20 AM]
pass two `Subject<bool>`s into your page VMs

moswald [8:20 AM]
those subjects are your `CanExecute`s

moswald [8:21 AM]
that way you keep your `ReactiveCommand` binding goodness

phil.cleveland [8:21 AM] 
I see. So set up the cmd with those and then the pages OnNext to define the enabled

phil.cleveland [8:21 AM]
Ok.  I like that

phil.cleveland [8:22 AM]
Thanks :simple_smile:

```var canGoBack = new Subject<bool>();
var canGoNext = new Subject<bool>();
BackButton = ReactiveCommand.Create(canGoBack);
NextButton = ReactiveCommand.Create(canGoNext);
this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.Router.CurrentViewModel)
                .Subscribe(cvm =>
                {
                    var page = Router.GetCurrentViewModel() as IWizardPage;
                    canGoBack.OnNext(page.CanMoveBack);
                    canGoNext.OnNext(page.CanMoveNext);

          ...
```
