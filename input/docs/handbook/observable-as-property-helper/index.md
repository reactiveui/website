The ObservableAsPropertyHelper (OAPH) is a class that simplifies the interop between an IObservable and a property on your View Model. It allows you to have a property which reflects the latest value that has been sent through the IObservable<T> stream. 
  
It will invoke the `INotifyPropertyChanged` and `INotifyPropertyChanging` based events for the View Model when the observable emits a new value. `ObservableAsPropertyHelper<T>` is very similar to a Lazy<T> in so far as it provides a Value member which provides the latest value of the Observable<T>. They are often read-only and reflect the IObservable<T> stream. It is common to combine ObservableAsPropertyHelper<T> with the `WhenAny` extensions. 

# Example

First, we need to declare an Output Property, using a class called
`ObservableAsPropertyHelper<T>`:

```cs
readonly ObservableAsPropertyHelper<string> firstName;
public string FirstName => firstName.Value;
```

Similar to read-write properties, this code should always be 100% boilerplate.
Next, we'll use a helper method `ToProperty` to initialize `firstName` in the
constructor. `ToProperty` has two overloads, one where it directly returns the OAPH
and another where the OAPH is returned in a `out` parameter. We generally recommend 
using the former approach due to better readability of the code:

```cs
firstName = this
    .WhenAnyValue(x => x.Name)
    .Select(name => name.Split(' ')[0])
    .ToProperty(this, x => x.FirstName);
```

Here, `ToProperty` creates an `ObservableAsPropertyHelper` instance which will
signal that the `FirstName` property has changed. If you prefer using the overload
where the OAPH is returned in a `out` parameter, then use the following code:

```cs
this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.Name)
    .Select(name => name.Split(' ')[0])
    .ToProperty(this, x => x.FirstName, out firstName);
```

### ToProperty()

`ToProperty` allows you to construct an `ObservableAsPropertyHelper<T>` from an `IObservable<T>`. When a new value has been added to the `IObservable<T>`, it will use the overload methods in the IReactiveObject interface to trigger the required events.

`ToProperty` is an extension method on `IObservable<T>` and semantically acts like a "Subscribe".

 ```cs
public static ObservableAsPropertyHelper<TRet> ToProperty<TObj, TRet>(
    this IObservable<TRet> target,
    TObj source,
    Expression<Func<TObj, TRet>> property,
    TRet initialValue = default(TRet),
    bool deferSubscription = false,
    IScheduler? scheduler = null)
```

The parameters of `ToProperty` allows you to specify the source of the property, often just the current class.
* An expression or a string to the Property that is exposed.
* Optionally the initial value being exposed by the Property before any values are emitted by the source observable. If you are deferring the subscription  this value may be the first value since the observable won't be immediately subscribed to.
* Optionally if you defer subscription that will not subscribe to the observable until the user accesses the Property. By default we will subscribe to the observable immediately so that you have the latest value.
* Optionally a scheduler, by default this will be CurrentThreadScheduler from where the call is made.

### Property vs ObservableAsPropertyHelper

You should use a property and `RaiseAndSetIfChanged` if you are intending to mutate the value.

`ObservableAsPropertyHelper` properties are useful for when you have "calculated" values, for example, if their value is solely the result of other properties. You will also use the `ObservableAsPropertyHelper` when you want to expose the latest value from a `IObservable<T>`.

`ObservableAsPropertyHelper` properties are helpful to remove spaghetti code where different methods and components may be mutating multiple locations. They also clearly define what values are used in the calculation of the value and help describe the dependent properties for the `ObservabeAsPropertyHelper`, unlike settable properties where you have to search the code base further for location where the value is mutating.

# Performance considerations

## nameof() instead of using default Index.
For performance based solutions you can also use the `nameof()` operator override of `ToProperty()`
which won't use the Expression.

```cs
firstName = this
    .WhenAnyValue(x => x.Name)
    .Select(name => name.Split(' ')[0])
    .ToProperty(this, nameof(FirstName));
```

## Defer Subscription
If you are creating a large number of OAPH, consider deferring your subscription. `ToProperty` also allows you to deferSubscription to the underlying `IObservable<T>`. Deferring the subscription not have the OAPH Subscribe to the base `IObserable<T>` until the Value property has been accessed. This is especially useful if you have more complex `IObservable<T>` because this approach is very close to the approach that `Lazy<T>` takes. 

```cs
// nameStatusObservable is IObservable<string>
var nameStatusObservable = this
    .WhenAnyValue(x => x.Name)
    .Select(name => GetLatestStatus(name));

// name is ObservableAsPropertyHelper<string>
name = nameStatusObservable
    .ToProperty(this, nameof(FirstName), deferSubscription: true);

// nameStatusObservable won't be subscribed until the 
// Name property is accessed.
private readonly ObservableAsPropertyHelper<string> name;
public string Name => name.Value; 
``` 

One caveat of deferring the subscription is if you aren't careful you'll have a invalid value until a new value is added to the `IObservable<T>`. If using Hot Observables consider using a `ReplaySubject<T>` and limiting the `ReplaySubject<T>` to 1 previous value in the constructor. 

```cs
public class StatusViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
    readonly ObservableAsPropertyHelper<string> status;
    public string Status => status.Value;
    
    public StatusViewModel()
    {
        var replayStatus = new ReplaySubject<string>(1);
        // .OnNext() the 'replayStatus' subject somewhere...

        // Note, that 'replayStatus' is also IObservable<string>, 
        // so we are allowed to add a call to .ToProperty() to
        // convert it to ObservableAsPropertyHelper<string>.
        status = replayStatus.ToProperty(this, nameof(Status), deferSubscription: true);
    }
}
```
