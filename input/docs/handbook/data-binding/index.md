A core part of being able to use the MVVM pattern is the very specific relationship between the ViewModel and View - that is, the View is connected in a one-way dependent manner to the ViewModel via *bindings*. ReactiveUI provides its own implementation of this concept, which has a number of advantages compared to platform-specific implementations such as XAML-based bindings.

* Bindings work on **all platforms** and operate the same.
* Bindings are written via Expressions. This means that they are strongly typed, and renaming a ViewModel property, or a control in the UI layout without updating the binding, the build will fail.
* Controlling how types bind to properties is flexible and can be customized.

## Getting Started

In order to use bindings in the View, you must first implement `IViewFor<TViewModel>` on your View. Depending on the platform, you must implement it differently:

* **iOS** - change your base class to one of the Reactive UIKit classes (i.e.
  `ReactiveViewController`) and implement `ViewModel` using
  `RaiseAndSetIfChanged`, *or* implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` on your View and
  ensure that ViewModel signals changes.

* **Android:** - change your base class to one of the Reactive Activity /
  Fragment classes (i.e. `ReactiveActivity<T>`), *or* implement
  `IViewFor<T>` on your View and ensure that your ViewModel signals
  changes.

* **Xaml-based:** - Implement `IViewFor<T>` by hand and ensure that ViewModel
  is a `DependencyProperty`. Additionally, for `UserControl`s you can use a base 
  class that encapsulates `IViewFor` behavior - `ReactiveUserControl<TViewModel>`.
  
### Platforms

For a detailed overview of the bindings on each platform, see the following sections:

* [Universal Windows Platform](./microsoft-store)

* [Xamarin.Forms](./xamarin-forms)

* [Xamarin.Android](./xamarin-android)

* [Xamarin.iOS](./xamarin-ios)

* [Windows Presentation Foundation](./windows-presentation-foundation)

* [Windows Forms](./windows-forms)

* [Avalonia UI](./avalonia)

## Types of Bindings

Once you implement `IViewFor<T>`, binding methods are now available as extension methods on your class, as well as [activation and deactivation](../when-activated) feature for your views and associated view models. Like many other things in ReactiveUI, you should only set up bindings in a constructor or even better in a [WhenActivated](../when-activated) block.

`OneWayBind`, `Bind`, `BindCommand` and `Subscribe` methods return an `IDisposable`. In general, you shouldn't care about this return value, except if you want to break a binding manually, or you're on a XAML-based platform, where bindings can leak memory. [WhenActivated](../when-activated) feature helps handle this concern gracefully.

* **OneWayBind:** - Sets up a one-way binding from a property on the ViewModel
  to the View.

```csharp
this.OneWayBind(ViewModel,
    viewModel => viewModel.Name,
    view => view.Name.Text);

// OR

this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.ViewModel.Name)
    .BindTo(this, view => view.Name.Text);
```

* **Bind:** - Sets up a two-way binding between a property on the ViewModel to
  the View.

```csharp
this.Bind(ViewModel, 
    viewModel => viewModel.Name, 
    view => view.Name.Text);
```

* **BindCommand:** - Bind an `ICommand` to a control, or to a specific event on that control (how this is implemented depends on the UI framework):

```csharp
// Bind the OK command to the button.
// This uses the default "Click" event on XAML-based platforms
// and equivalent events on Android and iOS.
this.BindCommand(ViewModel,
    viewModel => viewModel.OkCommand,
    view => view.OkButton);

// Bind the OK command to when the user presses a key
this.BindCommand(ViewModel,
    viewModel => viewModel.OkCommand,
    view => view.RootView,
    "KeyUp");
```

## Converting between types

Direct bindings between properties are convenient, but often the two types are not assignable to each other. For example, binding an "Age" property to a TextBox would normally fail, because the TextBox expects a string value. Instead, ReactiveUI has an extensible system for coercing between types.

For simple one-way bindings, you can use the conversion parameter in the `OneWayBind` method. This parameter is a `Func<TIn, TOut>`, so if the ViewModel property is of type `int` and the view property is of type `string`, it's a `Func<int, string>`
which means that you don't have to write custom converter classes, like in standard WPF bindings, and can just write a simple, statically typed, conversion function.

```csharp
// Note: Age is an integer, Text is a string
this.OneWayBind(ViewModel, 
    viewModel => viewModel.Age, 
    view => view.Name.Text, 
    value => value.ToString()); // In the last parameter, we .ToString() the integer
```

### Creating custom Value Converters classes

You can also register converters globally and convert types for two-way bindings. See [Value Converters](./value-converters) page for details.

## Choosing when to update the source

By default, the source of a binding will be updated when the target changes, which is equivalent to setting `UpdateSourceTrigger = PropertyChanged` on a WPF binding. Sometimes it is desirable to have more fine-grained control over when the source will be updated (for example, the binding updating will trigger some expensive work which isn't necessary on every keystroke).

One common requirement is to update the source when a user interface control loses keyboard (or logical) focus - WPF even provides `UpdateSourceTrigger = LostFocus` for this.

ReactiveUI bindings allow this by providing an `IObservable` as a parameter to the binding, which disables the default behavior and causes the source to update whenever the observable fires. The parameter (`SignalViewUpdate`) can be of any `IObservable<object>`, meaning that any event on a user interface control is capable of causing the binding to update.

For example, to have a binding update when a control loses keyboard focus, the following binding setup can be used:

```cs
// Note: We're using the ReactiveUI.Events NuGet package here, which 
// wraps traditional .NET events on UI controls into IObservables and 
// exposes them via the Events() extension method.
this.Bind(ViewModel, 
    viewModel => viewModel.SomeProperty, 
    view => view.SomeTextBox, 
    SomeTextBox.Events().LostKeyboardFocus);
```

## Why not use Subscribe?

This is a good question, as both `BindTo` and `Subscribe` provide similar functionality; both can be used to bind your view to viewModel properties. Take the following two examples, both result in the same outcome, just with different styles:

```cs
//1. Using BindTo
ViewModel.Name
         .Select(x => $"Label: {x}")
         .BindTo(this, x => x.loginButton.Text)
         .DisposeWith(disp);
```

```cs
//2. Using Subscribe
ViewModel.Name
         .Select(x => $"Label: {x}")
         .Subscribe(x => loginButton.Text = x)
         .DisposeWith(disp);
```

Although both are similar, `BindTo` does offer a number of benefits:

* Can handle globally registered converters - See the [Value Converters](./value-converters) page for details
* Can handle special semantics within the ReactiveUI binding engine - e.g. on WinForms there are a number of properties where the set methods are automatically called
* Provides a consistent style across multiple projects (iOS/Android...)

In general `BindTo` is the recommended approach to binding. However as with a lot of ReactiveUI, you are free to choose the style which suits you best.

# "Hack" bindings and BindTo

Should you find that direct one and two-way bindings aren't enough to get the job done (or should you want View => ViewModel bindings), a flexible, Rx-based approach is also available, via combining `WhenAnyValue` with the `BindTo` operator, which allows you to one-way-bind an arbitrary `IObservable` to a property on an object.

For example, here is a simple example of binding a ListBox's `SelectedItem` to a ViewModel:

```cs
public MainView()
{
    // Bind the View's SelectedItem to the ViewModel
    this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.SomeList.SelectedItem)
        .BindTo(this, x => x.ViewModel.SelectedItem);

    // Bind ViewModel's IsSelected via SelectedItem. Note that this
    // is only for illustrative purposes, it'd be better to bind this
    // at the ViewModel layer (i.e. WhenAnyValue + ToProperty)
    this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.SomeList.SelectedItem)
        .Select(x => x != null)
        .BindTo(this, x => x.ViewModel.IsSelected);
}
```

`BindTo` applies the same binding hooks and type conversion that other property binding methods do, so the types don't necessarily have to match between the source and the target property.

While you could certainly build complex bindings (even ones between two view models!), keep in mind that binding logic that you put in the View is untestable, so keeping the meaningful logic out of bindings is usually a Good Idea.

# "Hack" Command Bindings

Similarly to property bindings, you can also add custom Hack bindings for commands as well. Two methods that are useful for this are `InvokeCommand` and `WhenAnyObservable`. The former allows you to invoke a command whenever an Observable signals, and the latter allows you to safely get an Observable from a ViewModel in a safe way. Here's how they apply to commands:

```cs
//
// This code is all in the View constructor
//

// Invoke a command whenever the Escape key is pressed
this.Events().KeyUpObs
    .Where(x => x.EventArgs.Key == Key.Escape)
    .InvokeCommand(this, x => x.ViewModel.Cancel);

// Subscribe to Cancel, and close the Window when it happens
this.WhenAnyObservable(x => x.ViewModel.Cancel)
    .Subscribe(_ => this.Close());
```
