Title: Roadmap
---

Want to see something done sooner? Speak with one of the maintainers and ask how you can help as the easiest way to influence the direction or have a feature implemented earlier is to make significant, high-quality contributions and if you so desire, become a project maintainer.

# Now
- Improve quality of website documentation.
- Reference sample applications for each platform
- [Add ReactiveUI to Microsoft Windows Template Studio](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/1516)
- Improve contributor experience (pull-request reviews, issue triage, processes documented, work with visuals studio for mac product team and help them implement the features that are missing from their product)
- Encourage users and contributors to pull-request the website docs / lift high quality discussions from Slack and turn them into documentation
- Increase testing coverage, increase amount of platforms that are tested & implement daily builds on real physical devices on Azure DevOps.
- Higher transparency into tasks using GitHub projects.
- Cleanup our Github issue labels. Make it obvious to new contributors what tasks are friendly to them.
- Automate Tweeting our core product release notifications.

# Next
