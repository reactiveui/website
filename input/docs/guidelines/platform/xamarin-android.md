Title: Xamarin Android
---

Your viewmodels should inherit from `ReactiveObject`

- https://reactiveui.net/api/reactiveui/reactiveobject/

Use wireupcontrols

- https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/data-binding/xamarin-android/wire-up-controls

Use `ISupportsActivation` and `WhenActivated` for lifecycle

- https://reactiveui.net/api/reactiveui/isupportsactivation/
- https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/when-activated/

Keep references to your subscriptions

- https://reactiveui.net/docs/concepts/reactive-programming/subscriptions#lifecycle

Use disposables to manage lifetime, scope and resources:

- https://reactiveui.net/docs/concepts/reactive-programming/disposables

Don't use eventhandlers, use the extension methods shipped in `reactiveui.events` instead

- https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/events/

Use your normal Android concepts that you would usually use in Android development, we have some base classes which you should use as they expose observables such as `Changed`, `Changing` and `Deactivated` that can be used for composition.
